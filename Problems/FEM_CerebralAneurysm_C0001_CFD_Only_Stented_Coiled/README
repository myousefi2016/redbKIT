CFD interaction simulation in a cerebral aneurysm.

The fluid mesh provided in the "mesh" subfolder was obtained using the vmtk software 
starting from the stl files provided by the Aneurisk project, see

  http://ecm2.mathcs.emory.edu/aneuriskweb/index

Specifically, we consider here the case id C0001.

The "CFD" folder contains the data and main files required to run the simulation.
