##redbKIT : a MATLAB(R) library for reduced-order modeling of parametrized PDEs

redbKIT is a MATLAB library for finite element simulation and reduced-order modeling of Partial Differential Equations developed at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/) - [Chair of Modeling and Scientific Computing](http://cmcs.epfl.ch/)). 

In particular, it includes straightforward implementations of many of the algorithms presented in the companion book:

>[**[QMN16] A. Quarteroni, A. Manzoni, F. Negri. Reduced Basis Methods for Partial Differential Equations. An Introduction**, Springer, 2016.](http://www.springer.com/us/book/9783319154305#aboutBook)

`redbKIT` consists of three main packages: [`RB_library`](https://github.com/redbKIT/redbKIT/tree/master/RB_library), [`FEM_library`](https://github.com/redbKIT/redbKIT/tree/master/FEM_library) and [`Problems`](https://github.com/redbKIT/redbKIT/tree/master/Problems).
